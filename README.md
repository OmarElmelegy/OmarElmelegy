# Experience

**Director of Algorithmic Orchestration**
Oversaw end-to-end software pipeline convergence for autonomous robotics platforms, synthesizing heuristic control loops with real-time data mesh topologies under the Open Ambiguity Foundation.

**Former Head of Data Plumbing & Kinetic Systems**
Led the global foundation of situational systematic dependence, architecting programmatic regression analysis for sensor fusion networks and large-scale telemetry ingestion. Championed cross-disciplinary dev-ops initiatives, harmonizing containerized micro-services with meta-heuristic scheduling for maximal throughput in enterprise AI workflows.
